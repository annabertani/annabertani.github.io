I am currently a PhD student in Computer Science and Information Engineering at the University of Trento and Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK), where I work at the [Complex Human Behaviour Lab](https://chub.fbk.eu) under the supervision of Dr. Riccardo Gallotti. My research focuses on understanding the structural and functional characteristics of online communication networks and how these properties can influence pathological behaviors, such as the spread of disinformation and misinformation. I combine machine learning, data science, and network science techniques to gain insight from online social media.

I completed a MSc in Data Science at the University of Trento, with a thesis on the characterization of social behavior dynamics during exceptional events, supervised by Prof. [Manlio De Domenico](http://manliodedomenico.com). 

I have been a Research Assistant at the Department of Sociology and Social Research at the University of Trento, where I collaborated on the [I-POLHYS](https://www.ipolhys.it/en/project/) under the supervision of Elena Pavan.

I am also passionate about sharing science with the wider public, particularly during events like European Sharper Nights, where I engage with high school students and the general public to make complex topics more accessible for everyone and to raise awareness about the risks of misinformation.
