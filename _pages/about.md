I am currently a PhD student in Computer Science and Information Engineering at the University of Trento and Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK), where I work at the [Complex Human Behaviour Lab](https://chub.fbk.eu) under the supervision of Dr. Riccardo Gallotti. My research focuses on understanding the structural and functional characteristics of online communication networks and how these properties can influence pathological behaviors, such as the spread of disinformation and misinformation.

I completed an MSc in Data Science at the University of Trento, with a thesis on the characterization of social behavior dynamics during exceptional events, supervised by Prof. [Manlio De Domenico](http://manliodedomenico.com). 

I have been a Research Assistant at the Department of Sociology and Social Research at the University of Trento, where I collaborated on the [I-POLHYS](https://www.ipolhys.it/en/project/) under the supervision of Elena Pavan.

My broader research interests span network science, complex systems models of human behavior and online opinion dynamics.
